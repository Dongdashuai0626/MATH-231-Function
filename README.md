# MATH-231-Functions
These are functions I think will be helpful when we do our 231 HW.

If you have any questions or advice, please let me know. You can send me email in jiacheng.24@intl.zju.edu.cn

# **Lec 04: approximate integral** 

 ( You could invoke like *import integral* )

three functions in:midpoint simpson trapezoid

Based on the sympy, **Input** are (f,a,b,p,x).**output** are (T,E)

f represents the function you def like 22*sympy.sin(x) 

a,b represent the upper bound and the lower bound

p is the number of pieces the function is divided into

x is the independent variable, you should def it like *x = sympy.S("x")*

T is the number estimated

E is the maxerror

**This is the first time for me to push my code up. If you have any comments, please let me know so that I can continue to make progress. Thank you! I will continue to update if I have time. Everyone is welcome to participate as a contributor!!**
